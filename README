Compiling ProFeat from source
=============================

To build ProFeat from source code you will need GHC and cabal. The easiest way
to obtain these is to install the Haskell Platform. For download and
instructions see

  haskell.org/platform


You can build ProFeat by executing the following commands in the project's root
directory (the directory containing the profeat.cabal file):

  cabal sandbox init
  cabal install --only-dependencies
  cabal build
  cabal install

The executable will be written to .cabal-sandbox/bin/ inside the project's
root directory.


Running ProFeat
===============

To generate a PRISM model from a ProFeat model "example.profeat", run

  profeat example.profeat -o example.prism
