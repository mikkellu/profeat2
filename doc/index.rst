ProFeat documentation
=====================

Welcome to the ProFeat documentation.

ProFeat is a tool for the analysis of stochastic system families.
It provides a modeling language that extends the input language of the
probabilistic model checker `PRISM <http://www.prismmodelchecker.org>`_ by
feature-oriented concepts, including support for dynamic feature switches,
multi-features and feature attributes.

ProFeat follows a translational approach for the quantitative analysis of
system families. A ProFeat family model is translated into the input language
of PRISM. Then, the actual analysis is performed by invoking PRISM on the
translated models. The output generated by PRISM is then post-processed and
ProFeat presents the results for each family member in a feature-aware fashion.
